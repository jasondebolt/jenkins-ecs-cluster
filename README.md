#### Run a Jenkins cluster on AWS using Elastic Container Service

#### Local dependencies
* These scripts have only been tested on a mac
* $ brew install jq
* AWS CLI and AWS credentials.
* Python
* I didn't want anyone to have to enter IAM roles/users for access control, so I left the ECR Repo IAM permissions open.
